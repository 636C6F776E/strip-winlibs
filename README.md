### What
A batch file that strips WinLibs of bloat.

### How
Copy the file to WinLibs' root and run it. **Warning: it will delete files!**  
Feel free to edit it to your needs.

### Why
Because WinLibs shouldn't contain CMake, Doxygen and NASM in my opinion.  
Those tools should be managed independently of WinLibs.
